# PetTec (Snoop Cube) — csandk Fork — Home Assistant integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

A Home Assistant custom integration for the [PetTec Cam Buddy](https://pettec.de/products/pettec-cam-buddy-inkl-futterautomat)
feeder and the rest of the **Snoop Cube** camera lineup (Cam Free, Cam Lite, Cam 360, etc).

The integration talks to PetTec's cloud (the same backend the **Snoop Cube** mobile app
uses — operated by [Meari](https://www.meari.com.cn/) under the CloudEdge brand).

This is the [csandk fork](https://github.com/csandk/pettec-home-assistant) of
[woorari/pettec-home-assistant](https://github.com/woorari/pettec-home-assistant).
Its Home Assistant integration ID is `pettec_csandk`.

## Status

- ✅ Pet Cam Buddy — feed control, full state visibility, all detection toggles
- ✅ All other PetTec cameras — on/off, recording, motion/human/sound/PIR/cry detection, sensitivity sliders, SD card sensors, Wi-Fi, battery, firmware
- 🟦 Live video / playback / schedule editing — not yet (v0.3+)

## Features

- Single config flow (email + password)
- Automatic discovery of all cameras + feeders on the account, including shared (`asFriend`) devices
- Up to **20+ entities per device**: switch / number / sensor / binary_sensor / button
- Hourly cloud polling (configurable in code) — sufficient since feeder/camera state changes are infrequent
- Transparent **wake-on-write** for dormant battery cameras
- Multi-region: works with EU, US, and China Meari endpoints (auto-detected from login)
- Auto-retry if the cloud invalidates a session

## Installation

### Via HACS (custom repository)

1. In HACS → **Integrations** → top-right ⋮ menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/csandk/pettec-home-assistant` as **Integration**.
3. Find **PetTec (Snoop Cube) — csandk Fork** in the HACS integrations list and install it.
4. **Restart Home Assistant.**
5. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "PetTec (Snoop Cube) — csandk Fork"**.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/pettec_csandk/` into your HA config's `custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart HA.
3. Add the integration via the UI.

### Switching from the original integration

The fork uses a separate integration ID (`pettec_csandk` instead of `pettec`).
After installing and restarting HA, add **PetTec (Snoop Cube) — csandk Fork**
as a new integration. Existing configuration entries and entity IDs are not
automatically migrated. Disable the original integration before configuring the
fork to avoid competing cloud sessions, and update automations to use the new
entities.

## Configuration

Accounts with only cameras, only feeders, or a mix of both are supported.

The config flow asks for:

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email | yes | – | Snoop Cube account email |
| Password | yes | – | Snoop Cube account password |
| Country code | no | `DE` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, used during login |
| Phone code | no | `49` | Country dialing code, used during login |

> **Strongly recommended:** create a dedicated Snoop Cube account (e.g. `home-assistant@yourdomain`)
> and use the app's "share device" feature to grant it access to your cameras or feeders. Meari
> allows only one active session per account, so if HA and your phone share an
> account, every login from one bumps the other.

## Entities

Per discovered device (some are conditional — battery sensors only on battery
cams, pet alarm only on the feeder, etc.):

| Type | Entity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **button** | `feed_one_portion` | Cam Buddy only — dispenses one portion |
| **switch** | `active` | Camera on/off (sleepMode) |
| **switch** | `recording` | SD-card recording on/off |
| **switch** | `motion_detection` | Motion alerts on/off |
| **switch** | `human_detection` | Human-shape alerts |
| **switch** | `sound_detection` | Sound alerts |
| **switch** | `cry_detection` | Cry/whining alerts |
| **switch** | `human_tracking` | Auto-follow (PTZ cams only) |
| **switch** | `pir_detection` | PIR sensor (battery cams only) |
| **switch** | `pet_alarm` | Feeder bowl-tip alarm enable |
| **switch** | `pet_meow` | Pet sound mode (feeder) |
| **number** | `motion_sensitivity` / `sound_sensitivity` / `pir_sensitivity` | 0–10 sliders |
| **sensor** | `battery` | Battery cams: % |
| **sensor** | `wifi_strength` | Signal % |
| **sensor** | `firmware_version` | Diagnostic |
| **sensor** | `sd_card_status` / `sd_card_capacity` / `sd_card_remaining` | SD card |
| **sensor** | `today_feed_count` / `next_feed_time` / `food_out_minutes` / `desiccant_info` | Feeder only |
| **binary_sensor** | `charging` | Battery cams only |
| **binary_sensor** | `food_empty` / `desiccant_expired` / `pet_throw_warning` | Feeder only |

## Use in automations

```yaml
# Feed once at 8 AM and 6 PM
alias: Cat schedule
triggers:
  - trigger: time
    at: "08:00"
  - trigger: time
    at: "18:00"
actions:
  - action: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.pet_cam_buddy_feed_one_portion
```

```yaml
# Disable cameras when "home" mode is active
alias: Privacy when home
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.away_mode
    to: "off"
actions:
  - action: switch.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id:
        - switch.wohnzimmer_cam_active
        - switch.schlafzimmer_cam_active
```

## How it works

Authentication: 3DES password + HMAC-SHA1 signed body params against
`apis.cloudedge360.com` → returns `userToken` + `pfKey` (per-tenant access
credentials). Subsequent calls hit a regional mirror auto-detected from
the login response.

State reads use `/v2/app/iot/model/get/batch` — a single batch call covers
all devices, including dormant battery cams (which return cached state).
State writes go to `/openapi/device/config?action=set`. Battery cams in
`dormancy` are transparently woken via `/openapi/device/awaken` before
writes.

Feed: IoT property `850` (petFeed2) with payload `{"parts": 1}`.
Camera on/off: IoT property `118` (sleepMode) — note the inversion, value 0
means "active". See [`meari_api.py`](custom_components/pettec_csandk/meari_api.py)
for the full reference.

## Limitations

- The Meari cloud allows only **one active session per account**. If you (or your
  phone) log in to the same account, HA's session is invalidated. Use a dedicated
  shared account for HA.
- Cloud-only — no live video, no playback browsing, no schedule editing yet.
- This integration is not affiliated with PetTec or Meari.

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging by adding to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.pettec_csandk: debug
```

Restart HA, reproduce the problem, then share the relevant log lines.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The code is intentionally small and well-commented.

Run the regression tests with Python 3.13:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
python -m pytest tests
```
